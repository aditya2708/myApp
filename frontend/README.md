# Frontend

## Installing Chart Dependencies

To add the SVG-based charting dependencies used in the admin cabang reports, run the following commands from the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
expo install react-native-svg
npm install react-native-svg-charts
```

The first command keeps `react-native-svg` aligned with the Expo SDK, while the second installs the charting primitives consumed by the new report visualizations.
